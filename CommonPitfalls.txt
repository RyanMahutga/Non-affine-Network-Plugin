Common pitfalls when getting started:

1. This pluign will not run through FEBio Studio 2.

 You will need to run the .feb file with [open with >> febio4]
 or through the windows command prompt after registering the
febio4 command using environment PATH variables. With the 
command prompt open, navigate to the folder containing the 
.feb and network files using cd [folder], then run the simulation
using febio4 -i [filename].feb 
 
 2. FEBio says it failed loading the plugin due to invalid SDK 
 version. 
 
 Download and install the latest version of febio studio (febio
 solver version 4.1.0) and click the checkbox to install the 
 associated febio SDK. If this does not work, you may need to 
 recompile the plugin .dll which can be done by downloading the 
 VisualStudioFiles folder from GitHub and opening the .sln file
 with VisualStudio. You will need to update the include and 
 library directories for where the SDK was installed on your 
 local machine, then rebuild the solution.
